# Iterator_Design_Pattern

The Iterator Design Pattern allows sequential access to elements without exposing the inside logic. That means using the Iterator Design Pattern, we can access the elements of a collection sequentially without knowing its internal representations.

The collections in C#, like List, ArrayList, Array, etc., are containers containing many objects. In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the elements of the container. 

Data structure of the List will be different from the Data Structure of ArrayList and the same in the case of an Array. That means the storing mechanism of List will be different from the storing mechanism of Array and the storing mechanism of ArrayList in C#.

So, the main use of the Iterator Design Pattern is to access the elements (object1, object2, object3, object4, etc.) of a collection (i.e., List, ArrayList, Array, etc.) sequentially.

We use iterators quite frequently in our daily lives. For example, remote control of the TV. Remote control that we use: just pick up the TV remote control and start pressing the Up and Down or Forward and Back keys to iterate through the channels.
